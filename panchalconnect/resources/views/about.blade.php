        <p align="justify"> <b>"Panchal Connect"</b> is the platform made for the people especially for Panchal community. <br><br>
In Panchal community, there would be many boys and girls who are looking for their life partner. 
There are also many relatives who are looking for boy or girl for someone in their family. 
We are here to help those people in their search and they could find the appropriate girl or boy in their own community using our application. 
We know that this world is now becoming dynamic in nature where people are started believing the concept of marriage in other caste. 
I am not against it but I would like to say that even those who believe so, are having the feeling hidden inside them that 
it would be better and safe if their child gets married in their own caste. 
The reasons of this feeling are their personal attachment to the caste and 
it seems safer to be connected with own caste rather than the other caste as same caste are familiar in many ways and couple can get along very easily.
<br><br>
We also believe in the relations with the people in the society which can help in making marriage successful. 
For instance, when someone visits others house for arrange marriage of their children, both the families usually talk 
about the people who they know in the society and try to create some link with the other family through their common known 
relatives so that they can be connected. 
<br><br>
Having considered this, Panchal Connect will help you to achieve the same. 
We have brought you the similar kind of feature on this platform, Panchal Connect, which will help you to connect the same way. 
This feature is known as references, which you can add multiple of it and can also modify it as and when required. 
This references will help you to find the life partner on whom you can build trust by knowing that there is one or more references 
which are common to both the partners profile. This will create trust and also create connection link between each other and most importantly 
one will feel safe to get connected with others and proceed with the marriage. 
This will turn out happy marriage without worrying anything. 
This is the only platform where you can find this kind of unique functionality all over the internet.
<br><br>
To create something like this for our community was our dream and we would try our best to provide you with all support 
that is required in using this. And we assure you that we will constantly monitoring this application and maintain it well. 
Our primary values are to help people in various ways, so we are starting with this matrimonial application but we will also be 
looking forward to other ways where we can help in our community other than this matrimonial application in future.
